# Marco Paulo Morais — Product Leader, Digital Transformation

**Group Product Manager, Digital Platform @ Secil** · ex-**tb.lx (Daimler Trucks & Buses)** · ex-**Defined.ai** · Founder **LogerMalin.fr**

I love seeing a good idea become real. Over the past 15+ years I’ve taken on roles from software engineer to startup founder and group product manager, and along the way I’ve learned that the magic happens when business insight, user empathy, and technical craft meet. At **Secil** I build and lead our Digital Platform—developing AI‑enabled products that support decarbonisation, safety, and performance. I mentor product teams to grow in autonomy and embed a product culture across industrial operations. Before that, at **tb.lx (Daimler)**, I helped design charging‑optimisation logic for electric trucks; at **Defined.ai** I delivered multilingual speech‑data pipelines for Fortune‑500 AI systems; and back in Paris I founded **LogerMalin.fr**, a semantic real‑estate platform that enriched property searches long before that was cool.

## Why I’m here
Because I believe we’re only scratching the surface of what thoughtful product management and modern AI/ML can do together. Digital transformation isn’t just about technology; it’s about changing how people work, decide, and create value. I’ve seen first‑hand how 50 % faster data access and a data‑driven culture change a company’s trajectory, how 20 % energy savings and hours of time reclaimed each month free teams to focus on higher‑impact work, and how a clear product‑operating model can turn a handful of product owners into a thriving organisation. Those experiences fuel my curiosity: What can we build next? How can we apply ML to predict problems before they happen? Which human stories will that unlock?

## What’s next on this page
Right now you’ll find my story and interests. Soon, I plan to use this space to share curated examples of my work—architecture patterns, lightweight demos, and lessons learned at the intersection of product leadership, AI/ML, and digital platforms. Think of it as a journal for exploring how we build better products, and a place to connect with like‑minded builders.
